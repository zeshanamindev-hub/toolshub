## Project Specific Instructions

This is a Next.js application with Task Master integration. The project includes:
- Frontend task management UI at `/tasks` 
- API route at `/api/tasks` serving Task Master data
- Task Master configuration in `.taskmaster/` directory

When working on tasks:
1. Use Task Master MCP tools for task management
2. Frontend changes should maintain the existing UI design patterns
3. API changes should preserve the current data structure
4. Always test both the frontend and API integration
