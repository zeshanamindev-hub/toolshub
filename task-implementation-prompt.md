Task ID: 3

Authoritative references

Codebase: src/app/**
Plan, Context and Questions: 
Latest official docs (read before each implementation): Next.js App Router, Zod, Tailwind CSS 4, shadcn/ui 3, Radix UI, Zustand, TanStack Query, React Hook Form
Project guardrails (must follow)

TypeScript everywhere; Next.js App Router
Always add types/interfaces etc in "types" folder
Always use shadcn/ui 3 and Radix UI for components

Workflow

Discovery (read-only)

Retrieve the task/subtask details from Taskmaster and read any linked context.
Explore the exact files to be changed (APIs, services, db schema/migrations, auth, types). Quote small snippets and line ranges where helpful.
Consult latest docs (Next.js, Zod, Tailwind CSS 4, shadcn/ui 3, Radix UI, Zustand, TanStack Query, React Hook Form) to validate patterns and APIs you will use.
Implementation plan (for approval) Produce a concise, diff-oriented plan that includes:

Overview: what is being implemented and why (tie to plan file(s))
Impacted files/modules (absolute paths)
Exact edits (per file): what to add/remove/replace;
Observability: key logs and error handling approach
Acceptance criteria: binary, verifiable checks
Make sure to check if the task is already done or not.
Answers to these questions:
Is this must-have or nice-to-have?
Which files/modules/folders are impacted?
When should this be done (now vs later) and why?
What are this task’s dependencies?
Is this task already done or not?
Implementation (after approval)

Apply edits per plan;
Completion

Run linting and formatting: npm run lint && npm run format
If tests pass, mark the subtask as done and append implementation notes summarizing:
What changed (files/classes/functions)
Any follow-ups or risks
Commit changes to git with a descriptive commit message (standard format without Claude attribution)
Notes & tips

Always anlayze the latest codebase, previous tasks done and latest docs of any libraries/packages involved to have the most accurate and up to date information before making the plan.
